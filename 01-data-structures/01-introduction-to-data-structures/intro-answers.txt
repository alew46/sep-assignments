Line Assignment:

1: My data structure allows developers to access and manipulate data by first
storing elements within an array, then providing several class methods that enable
some of the basic CRUD tasks expected from such a structure. For example, my .join
and .leave methods essentially just call basic built-in ruby array methods for adding
and deleting entrants according to the prescribed behavior.

2: To find a specific element in the data structure, a developer could utilize
the .search method which can accept a string as an argument. It instantiates a
variable ("result") and sets result to the person being searched for if and only
if it locates that value inside of the array. Otherwise, it returns nil.

3: The data structure could represent any data that was well-suited to representation
in the form of the list, if the list required that new entrants were added to the
back of the list by default. For example: a grocery shopping list where the user
wanted the oldest items to remain at the top of the list so they weren't forgotten.
